# Fake-News-Classification

Overview:
Fake news is a growing problem that erodes trust in legitimate sources of information. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to automatically identify fake news articles based on their text content.

Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data). This dataset provides labeled news articles, where each article is classified as real or fake.

How it Works:
* Data Collection & Labeling: We gather a dataset of news articles with labels marking them as real or fake. This is like gathering police reports with details of real crimes and fabricated stories.
* TF-IDF Vectorization: We analyze the text using a technique called TF-IDF. This assigns weights to words, highlighting those important for distinguishing real from fake news (like unusual word choices). Imagine the detective focusing on specific details in witness statements, not common phrases.
* NLTK Stop Word Removal: We remove common words like "the" or "a" using tools like NLTK. These don't hold much value in identifying fake news, similar to how the detective might disregard background noise from a crime scene.
* Model Creation & Training: We choose a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) and train it on the processed data. This trains the model to recognize patterns in the weighted words, similar to the detective learning to identify patterns in criminal behavior.

Dependencies:
* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* nltk
* pandas

Getting Started:
* Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip install scikit-learn nltk pandas).
* Clone the repository or download the code files.
* Run the main script, providing necessary input parameters.
* Receive the fake news.

Note:
* The effectiveness of this classification may vary based on the quality and quantity of the dataset used.
* Further optimization and fine-tuning can be done to enhance classifications accuracy.
